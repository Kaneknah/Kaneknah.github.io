## Description

This project was a challenge to restructure CSS and HTML on a visually satisfactory but poorly written application. (Include link) This project was created to gain experience in streamlining concepts such as vs. use, Semantic Tag Elements, duplicated CSS attributes and Universal Access. The provided starter code was written to lack the semantic tag elements as well as have duplicated and unnecessary CSS attributes. While this code technically worked, it was repetitive and confusing to read. By adding Semantic Tag Elements and drying up the CSS attributes I was able to create a more streamline code without altering the original output for the webpage.

The following issues were resolved in this process
-Changed elements int Semantic Elements with more precise naming in HTML and their corresponding CSS partners -Added a Title in the section
-Changed different 's to Classes to limit the input of different CSS attributes
-Fixed missing link in Navigation bar.
-Added alternatives for images to allow for universal access.
-Deleted duplicated CSS attributes.

This project was beneficial to me because it provided practice in observing "wet" code that is overly repetitive or confusing, but still completes the job it is required to do. by "drying" up the code and removing excess CSS content, I was able to gain understanding in how code can and should be minimized to the least amount possible to achieve a goal.
